As a platform-based approach to online threat reduction, NS8 Complete Storefront Protection is designed to help your eCommerce businesses fight the three big revenue killers: order fraud, advertising fraud, and poor performance.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>Revenue Killer #1: Order Fraud&nbsp;<\/strong><\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>NS8 Complete Storefront Protection watches and scores every visitor to your store. When we detect suspicious activity before, during, or after an order is placed, it is reflected in the order&rsquo;s EQ8 score. An order with a low score is most likely fraudulent, and depending on how low the score is, it is held or flagged for manual review. When an order&rsquo;s score is low enough to be suspicious, but not low enough for the store administrator to confidently cancel the order, NS8 Compete Storefront Protection provides the tools to escalate the order and request e-mail and SMS text verification from the user. If the user verifies their phone number, the store administrator can process the order with confidence.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>Revenue Killer #2: Advertising Fraud&nbsp;<\/strong><\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>Advertising fraud (especially remarketing fraud) is a huge and growing issue for online merchants. Up to 34% of online advertising campaign budgets are stolen using fraudulent traffic. NS8 Complete Storefront Protection not only scores all of the traffic visiting your store, but it also detects and records the traffic&rsquo;s source. You will see when, and which, advertising campaigns are delivering low-quality, high-risk, fraudulent traffic. You will be able to save money and increase revenue by eliminating poorly performing campaigns and focusing your budget on the successful campaigns that deliver results.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>Revenue Killer #3: Poor Performance&nbsp;<\/strong><\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>NS8 Complete Storefront Protection includes five critical monitors that every PrestaShop store should have to ensure their store&rsquo;s performance and customer experience.
